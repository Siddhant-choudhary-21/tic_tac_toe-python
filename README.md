This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. The game can be played by two players on the same machine, taking turns to place their mark (either "X" or "O") on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins. The game also checks for a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.


Features

Two-player mode: Players alternate turns to place their marks on the grid.

Win detection: The game checks for a winner after every move (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

Draw detection: If the grid is full and there is no winner, the game declares a draw.

User-friendly interface: The game uses simple text-based output to show the game board after each move.
